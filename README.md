# Searching-UniProt

As a biologist I am always having to look up the function of genes one at a time by copy pasting the gene names into UniProt. Here I created a python script which can be run in the terminal that automates the proces. You can provide either a .csv file with a list of interesting genes or enter a genes into the terminal separated by space.

If you provide a .csv file, the file should have a column named 'genes', the file name will be as 'site' information
