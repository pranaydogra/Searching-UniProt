# Searching-UniProt

As a biologist I am always having to look up the function of genes one at a time by copy pasting the gene names into UniProt. Here I created a python script which can be run in the terminal that automates the proces. You can provide either a .csv file with a list of interesting genes or enter a genes into the terminal separated by space.

If you provide a .csv file, it should have a column named 'genes'. In this case the file name will be to get the 'tissue site' information which is used to name the output .doc file.
